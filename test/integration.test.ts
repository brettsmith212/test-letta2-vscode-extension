   * This is a placeholder for a full integration test.
   * 
   * In a real-world setting, you would use @vscode/test-electron to launch a VS Code instance
   * and verify that the extension activates correctly and can perform its main functions.
   * 
   * The implementation would typically:
   * 1. Launch VS Code with the extension loaded
   * 2. Execute the letta-chat.openChat command
   * 3. Wait for the chat panel to open
   * 4. Send a test message to verify API communication
   * 5. Verify that a response is received
   * 
   * However, this requires:
   * - A running Letta AI server configured at http://localhost:8283
   * - Proper CI/CD environment setup to handle GUI applications
   * - Mocks for VS Code APIs that are difficult to test
   * 
   * For the purpose of this implementation plan, we're providing this documented
   * placeholder instead of a fully working integration test.
