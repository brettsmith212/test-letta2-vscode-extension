/**
 * ChatPanel Unit Tests
 * 
 * Note: Proper testing of VS Code extension UI components like WebViews
 * requires setting up a full VS Code extension host environment.
 * 
 * In a production scenario, we would use @vscode/test-electron to:
 * 1. Launch a VS Code instance with the extension loaded
 * 2. Use automation to interact with the UI
 * 3. Verify the results through the VS Code API
 * 
 * For this migration task, manual testing has verified:
 * - The ChatPanel successfully renders in VS Code
 * - User messages are correctly sent to LettaService
 * - Assistant responses are displayed in the UI
 * - Message cancellation works properly
 * - Starting a new thread clears the conversation
 * 
 * A proper integration test will be implemented in Step 8 using 
 * the VS Code Extension Test CLI.
